                        In Kerbal Space Program, take charge of the space program for the alien race known as the Kerbals. You have access to an array of parts to assemble fully-functional spacecraft that flies (or doesnâ€™t) based on realistic aerodynamic and orbital physics. Launch your Kerbal crew into orbit and beyond (while keeping them alive) to explore moons and planets in the Kerbol solar system, constructing bases and space stations to expand the reach of your expedition.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Kerbal Space Program features three gameplay modes. In Science Mode, perform space experiments to unlock new technology and advance the knowledge of Kerbalkind. In Career Mode, oversee every aspect of the space program, including construction, strategy, funding, upgrades, and more. In Sandbox, you are free to build any spacecraft you can think of, with all parts and technology in the game.                  
                        <br/><br/>
                        The player administers a space program operated by Kerbals, a species of small green humanoids, who have constructed a spaceport on their home planet of Kerbin. From the space center players can build various vehicles such as rockets, aircraft, spaceplanes, and rovers from a provided set of components. Constructed craft can be launched from the space center's launch pad or runway to accomplish various tasks while avoiding partial or catastrophic failure (such as lack of fuel or structural failure). 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Players control flight with little assistance other than a Stability Assist System (SAS) to keep their rocket oriented. Provided it maintains sufficient thrust and fuel, a spacecraft can enter orbit around Kerbin, or travel to other celestial bodies. To visualize vehicle trajectories, the player is provided a 'map' mode that displays the current vehicle's trajectory as well as that of celestial bodies and other spacecraft, as well as their orbital parameters. Spacecraft maneuver 'nodes' can be plotted, timed, and executed, and objects can be selected and 'targeted' to facilitate flybys, rendezvous, and docking.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Missions (either player-set or assigned "contracts") involve goals such as reaching a certain altitude, escaping the atmosphere, reaching a stable orbit, landing on a certain planetary body, rescuing stranded astronauts, capturing asteroids, and creating space stations and surface bases. Players may also set challenges for each other on the game's forums, such as visiting all five moons of the gas giant Jool, or use mods to test each other's aircraft in air combat tournaments.
                        Players can control in-game Kerbal astronauts, who can exit spacecraft on extravehicular activities (EVAs). 
                        <br/><br/>
                        While on EVA, Kerbals may use their EVA suit to maneuver in space, similar to the use of NASA's Manned Maneuvering Unit. Kerbals on EVA can collect and cache science experiments, plant flags on the surfaces of planets and moons, and repair spacecraft.

                        Historical space missions can be implemented and flown in the game, such as an Apollo Moon landing, the Curiosity rover, and the International Space Station. Certain parts in the game are based on real-life spacecraft, such as the Probodobodyne Stayputnik (an analogue of Sputnik 1), the Mk1-3 Command Pod (Apollo CM), and the KS-25 'Vector' (RS-25). 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Various community-developed mods can add features such as additional parts, informational displays detailing orbital characteristics, and autopilot functionalities. Some mods have implemented into the core game, due to popularity. For example, resource mining, to get ore for refining into fuel, has been implemented from a popular mod.

                        The game's solar system is loosely based on the real-world Solar System, consisting of the planets Moho, Eve, Kerbin, Duna, Dres, Jool, and Eeloo, which are respectively analogues of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Jupiter, and Pluto. Eve is orbited by Gilly, a small captured asteroid; Kerbin is orbited by two moons, the larger Mun and the smaller, more distant Minmus; and Duna is orbited by Ike, a large rocky moon. Jool possesses 5 moons: Laythe, an ocean world with a breathable atmosphere; Vall, an icy moon; Tylo, a rocky moon the size of Kerbin; and Bop and Pol, two small irregular moons. Various community mods implement extended or alternative planetary systems, including an exact-size real-world Solar System.
